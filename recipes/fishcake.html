    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>Fish</strong> - fish fillet, firm and meaty or artificial substitute.</p>
        <p><strong>Seasoning</strong> - salt, black pepper, oregano</p>
        <p><strong>Coating</strong> - First coat with 1tbs flour, 1tbs water and one egg, add another level of coating with bread crumbs <em>totally optional</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Lemon juice</strong> - for toping</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Heat oven and Season Fish</strong> - Set a rack in the middle of your oven and heat to 450 degrees F. Meanwhile, pat fish dry (I used salmon fillet that's about 1 to 1 ½-inch thick) and season with salt on both sides. 
            Cut the fish into pieces or sticks that are about 3-inch long (so the sticks would be 1 ½ inches thick and about 3 inches long). 
            Combine 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, and 1 teaspoon oregano and season the fish sticks on both sides. </p>
        <p><strong>Prepare a Coating Station</strong> - One dish of all-purpose or gluten free flour. One dish with the egg wash (1 egg + 1 tablespoon of water). And bread crumbs in the last dish.</p>
        <p><strong>Coat the Fish Sticks</strong> - Take each fish stick and coat it with the flour first. Shake off excess flour, then dip the fish stick in the egg wash. Finally, coat the fish stick in the bread crumb.</p>
        <p><strong>Bake</strong> - Bake in the heated oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until cooked.</p>
        <p><strong>Eat</strong> - Eat to gain up to 100 health.
